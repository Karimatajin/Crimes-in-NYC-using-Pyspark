# Crimes-in-NYC-using-Pyspark



Big data analysis using spark on NYC opendData. In this notebook, I am capriciously using Spark, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn without any meaningful distinction of purpose. The point is:

1- Perform data reading, transforming, and querying using Apache Spark.

2- Visualize using existing Python libraries. 

1- Installation of Pyspark on the local machine.

2- Download data from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?tags=crime

3- Open the jupyter notebook and run the cells, after updating the correct file path.
